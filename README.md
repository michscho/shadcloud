# shadcloud

Build your cloud modules that you can copy and past in your projects.

## Status

Idea for a project inspired by `https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui` as those terraform projects quite often look the same.

### Tasks

- [ ] create a `shacdn` like registry
- [ ] most probably cdk and tf modules variants
- [ ] create community driven development
